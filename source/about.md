My name is Zhong Xuan Khwa, a final-year student in **Yale-NUS College**, a
small liberal arts college in Singapore. I major in Mathematical, Computational,
and Statistical sciences, with a keen interest in Natural Language Processing,
Graph Theory, and all kinds of work that bridge these two fields. 

Outside of academics, I am the President of the Yale-NUS Ballroom Society, where
I've been dancing Standard Ballroom for the past 3 years. Furthermore, I
co-manage the Yale-NUS Brewhouse Project, a student-run, non-profit coffee cart
which serves good, affordable coffee every morning during the school term. Other
than that, I also enjoy Swing Dancing, which I picked up during my exchange in
Copenhagen.
